## About

> Iâ€™m a software engineering leader, with a passion for transforming ideas into working software product. I lead a team, empower people and build innovative software. 

_When I'm not developing software, you can find me running on treadmill,  making memories with my baby girls, practicing folk dance with my wife or reading books. I believe that creative inspiration can be found anywhere and I'm always looking for new ways to expand my horizon._

Once you know what it is in life that you want to do, then the world basically becomes your library. Everything you view, you can view from that perspective, which makes everything a learning asset for you.
